# YoutubePlaylistWatcher

An android TV app made for the elderly that cannot navigate YouTube and want to watch a collection of the same videos. App allows users to add new folders, videos and playlists which are saved in Firebase Realtime Database and Users log/sign in managed through firebase auth. Implemented a YouTube using YouTube player library to play videos with basic controller functionality. Resume function implemented using shared preferences. Used YouTube Data API to retrieve all necessary data.
